Figure out the following error
	- helper bot created an event
	- didn't join
	- kicked myself from its event

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/student/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/discord/client.py", line 218, in _run_event
    await coro(*args, **kwargs)
  File "bot.py", line 310, in on_message
    await bot.kick(message)
  File "bot.py", line 251, in kick
    authorAdminEvents = await self.displayAdminEvents(message, self.commandsId)
  File "bot.py", line 111, in displayAdminEvents
    await self.listArray(authorAdminEvents)
  File "bot.py", line 92, in listArray
    if int(i.getUserLimit()) == 0:
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '!createEvent'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The error abovve is fixed and we can kick a user from an event

The next problem is being able to leave an event. We can list all the events we are joined in, but something weird happens when we try to leave the event. I think it has something to do with the way
values are entered.

Need to make sure kick works and it doesn't end up breaking any other method once ran, from there we can move on to implementing leaveEvent and end
After we get end written I think it'd be in our best interest to refactor the code
